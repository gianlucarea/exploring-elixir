# Exploring Elixir

Welcome to my Elixir repository! This repo is structured into two main sections: **Elixir in Action** and **Dockyard Curriculum**. The **Dockyard Curriculum** section contains my progress through Elixir tutorials and courses, while the **Elixir in Action** section includes the code I wrote following Elixir in Action Book.
